# Active projects

* **[apollo][]:** A Lua to C++ binding library, written in modern C++11.
* My [**Vim configuration**][vimrc] is, of course, a never ending story.
* This blog. ;-)

[vimrc]: https://github.com/Oberon00/vimrc


# Other projects
* **[luabind (fork)][luabind]:** A fork of the popular Lua to C++ binding
  library that was written before C++11 was a thing.
* **[Jade 2D game engine][jd]:** Based on [SFML][] and the luabind fork above.
* **[FloodFill][]:** A 2D puzzle game; the only game ever made with the above
  engine.
* **[ssig][]:** A tiny signals & slots ("events") library for C++, because
  [Boost.Signals2][bsig] was too slow.

# Notable contributions

* I [helped fix a bug][fpbug] that affected all Android 4.x and 5.x kernels for the
  Samsung Galaxy S2, Note 1, and other Exynos 4210 devices. It was merged e.g in
  [CyanogenMod 11][fpbug-cm11].
